# ðŸ‘£ Footprinting

## What's Footprinting?

Gather as much **public** information as possible about the target.

## Will I be detected?

There're two types of footprinting:

* **Passive Footprinting**: no direct interaction. It will never be detected.
* **Active Footprinting**: direct interaction. It may leave traces for the target.

## What do we want to know during footprinting?
